This project focuses on securing a campus network by implementing multiple security measures, including web access restrictions, firewall configurations, and intrusion detection systems (IDS). The goal is to protect network resources from unauthorized access, malware, and external threats while ensuring seamless connectivity for students and staff.

Web Access Restriction: Using Cisco Packet Tracer, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are configured on routers to restrict access to non-educational or malicious websites, ensuring compliance with institutional policies.
Firewall Implementation: A firewall solution (such as pfSense or Cisco ASA) is deployed to filter traffic, block unauthorized connections, and prevent DDoS attacks using VLANs, NAT, and DMZ configurations.
Intrusion Detection System (IDS): An IDS (e.g., Snort or Suricata) is integrated into the network to monitor traffic, detect anomalies, and prevent potential cyber threats.
Technologies Used:
Cisco Packet Tracer, ACLs, VLANs, pfSense, Cisco ASA, NAT, DMZ, IDS (Snort/Suricata), Networking Protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS).
This comprehensive approach ensures a secure and well-managed campus network environment, balancing security with accessibility.
